# EVCC E-Ink Monitor
A ESP8266 based IoT Device as a EVCC status monitor.

## About
The aim of this project is to use the EVCC Rest-API to realize a basic Monitor to show the actual status on a low power E-Ink Display.

The software was primarily developed and tested for the Waveshare E-Ink Display 400x300, 4.2inch E-Ink raw display, three-color. The ESP8266 controller will frequently aquire the status of the evcc server and Update the Display to visualize the actual status.

## Features
1. Easy to setup Config MenÃ¼, thanks to IoTWebConf
2. Statuspage for quick functional checks
3. Accesspoint for inital setup (via phone, computer, tablet)
4. Several Options if no Car is connected (Wallbox idle) -> Clear, EVCC Logo or 24h PVGraph
5. Fast Display Update if Setting change have been detected
6. Adjustable update rate for data and display

## Knows Issues / Limitations
1. Admin Login Password is shown on the Display during startup (this is a Security issue and might change in the future)
2. No Support for multiple Loadpoints
3. No Input capabilities, display only
4. I had to rewrite large parts of the waveshare software to get non-blocking code, so the code examples are no longer compatible with other displays. (Including some bugfixes)
